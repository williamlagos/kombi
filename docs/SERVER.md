#### 🚀️ Application Server (backend/server) 
- That's our V8 runner. Built with Node.js and many preselected npm packages, the Mars.js Server is built to be highly extensible and provide tight integrations with the client application.
- In order to achieve that, we use the Swagger OpenAPI Specification to generate an easy to use client module that is shipped with the frontend/client application and can be updated everytime there are changes on the server by running `npm run client:generate:api` on the root of the project.
- With that, we abstracted the backend calls layer to simple function invocations, such as: `Backend.getCustomer(1234)` insted of `http.get('http://my-server-address/api/customers/1234')`. Easy, huh?
- Talk is cheap, let's dive into the server folder structure:
    ```
